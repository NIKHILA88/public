Welcome! 

You'll find various dashboards and whitepapers that I've created for customers here. Feedback is always appreciated.

## Whitepapers

* [Disk Diagnosis: Digging Deep with Monitoring Console and More](https://github.com/dpaper-splunk/public/blob/master/whitepapers/Digging%20Deep%20into%20Disk%20Diagnoses.pdf). This whitepaper, also published at https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/technical-briefs/disk-diagnosis-digging-deep-with-monitoring-console-and-more.pdf, walks a Splunk admin through using the Monitoring Console and Linux CLI tools to closely observe disk performance to determine if a number of metrics are within an acceptable range. 

* [Splunk Upgrade Pre-, In-situ-, and Post- Validation Steps](https://github.com/dpaper-splunk/public/blob/master/whitepapers/Upgrade%20pre-%2C%20in-situ-%2C%20and%20post-%20validation%20steps.pdf). This whitepape provides specific checklists for items to review before, during and after Splunk Enterprise core upgrades to pave the way for a smooth upgrade. It does not provide specific upgrade procedures which will be customized to the environment, but takes a more holistic approach to answer the questions of "Am I good to go for an upgrade? How do I know an upgrade went successfully? What should I look for to compare before and after my upgrade?"
